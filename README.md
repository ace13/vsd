====

`noide`is a web-based code editor built using Node.js.

At it's core it's a useful, lightweight editor so you don't leave your browser to write code.

Thanks for taking a look. Any comments, feedback or support use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/node_ide).


Instructions
============

`npm install noide -g`

Then cd to the directory you want to edit and execute

`noide`

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

You should see a page something like this:

*** WARNING ***:
================
If you'd like to try out this IDE that's great and thanks BUT USE CAUTION.

Ensure any code is backed up regularly.
I would not like it to be responsible for any work lost.

Also, there is no authentication or security built in. That is left to you. Do not run on a publicly accessible server/port.


Features
========

`noide`â€™s current features:

- File explorer tree view

- Syntax highlighted code editing for many programming languages

- Find/Find+Replace
- JSLINT validation warning

Built using:
============

- [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node)
- [ace editor](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
- [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
- [socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io)


Build
=====

To build `noide` you will need browserify and the less compiler installed:

`npm i browserify -g`

`npm i lessc -g`

Then it's `npm run build` in the directory you installed `noide` to.

This will compile the `js` and `less` files.
You will need to do this if you want to change the editors settings.

Settings
========
Settings for the editor can be found in `/src/client/editor/config.json`.
You can change all the settings of the actual code editor in there. E.g. indentation and theme.

All the theme names can be found on here [ACE Editor](http://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html).

To change the bootstrap theme of `noide` itself you can find the less files in `public/less/`.
The `themes` directory contains two themes a light and dark one. Others can be downloaded
from [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) or just create your own. Edit the `bootstrap.less`
file with the theme name and run the build.
