Instructions
=====

npm install -g vsd

Then `cd` into the directory you want to view and execute: 

`vsd`

The default port is 3000. To change this use the command

`PORT=XXXX vsd`

*** WARNING ***:
================
If you'd like to try out this editor that's great BUT PLEASE USE CAUTION.

Ensure any code is backed up regularly.
I would not like it to be responsible for any work lost.

Also, there is no authentication or security built in. That is left to you. Do not run on a publicly accessible server/port.


Features
========

`visdev`â€™s current features:

- File explorer tree & finder-style view
- File operations (create/delete/rename files and directories etc.)
- Syntax highlighted code editing for many programming languages
- HTML/CSS/JS beautifiers
- Find/Find+Replace
- JSLINT validation warning
- Emmet
- Code snippets
- DB Schema Designer

There are two special folder names `vsd` looks for:

# Database Models

Create any folder with the name ending in `.db` and `vsd` will treat this as a database directory.
Any `.json` file contained within will be assumed to be a database model definition.
`vsd` will then present a visual GUI db designer. While the designer is modelled heavily on
functionality available in `mongoose`, the model created is abstracted and could be used to
create db schema to generate databases than mongo.

The npm package [vsd-db-mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vsd-db-mongoose) converts
the `.json` to mongoose schema that can then be used. This is currently the only generator
available.

There are several demo models contained in the `test` directory. Here's some screenshots:

You can create some neat visualizations of the schema:
